I don't want to start this post off by saying 'In honor of 2020' because that would feel wrong. Perhaps I should say something a little more neutral or indicating a feeling of uncertainty or relief or cautiousness or what have you - because I'm pretty sure all of us are treading lightly into 2021 feeling some of those feelings.

I'm not entirely sure how I'd like to _commemorate_ 2020 in music, exactly. I personally think it's a year that deserves no accolades or remembrance as a direct result of the global pandemic and it's effects, the unprecedented race revolution brought on by the murder of George Floyd and thousands of other black lives, and the complete failure of American democracy amid both of these drawn out events.

And these horrors don't even scratch the surface of what people are going through on an individual level. I, for one, lost my job in September, experienced the death of our family's lifelong pupper and companion (RIP Lucky boy), and am battling depression and anxiety like I've never experienced before without the health insurance to combat them properly. And I know that others are in a _much worse_ situation than I am.

But, despite all of these things during this horrid year, 2020 _did_ allow us to experience the [transition of Chromatica ii into 911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58hoktsqk_Q "Lady Gaga - 911 (Short Film)"), people subscribed to Disney Plus only so that they could listen to and watch [Beyonce's visual album](https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/black-is-king?cid=DSS-Search-Google-71700000070334051-&s_kwcid=AL!8468!3!453146789684!e!!g!!black%20is%20king&gclid=Cj0KCQiAlsv_BRDtARIsAHMGVSby116d_UkVRW5-eatnBK5eBb0SUHUxkorryedlMrYN29qzoZrpRuoaAi_REALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds "Black is King") (at least that's why I subscribed), and Dua Lipa [gave us a reason to get in shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvVonQ7LUJ0 "Dua Lipa - Let's Get Physical Work Out (Official Video)").

I'm not saying we should throw our hands up and rejoice now that 2020 is over. Many of us are still very vulnerable and going into 2021 with a lot of the same problems we've had. I _do_, however, think we've earned some time to pause - even if only for a moment - and reflect on some of the best music we experienced in 2020. And with that, here are some of my favorites, in no particular order:

# Dua Lipa - "Physical"

> ##### Released January 30th, 2020
>
> From the album: [Future Nostalgia](https://open.spotify.com/album/7fJJK56U9fHixgO0HQkhtI?si=0jmzGr_wSzSuQkH58-CYGw "Future Nostalgia by Dua Lipa")

[![Dua Lipa - Physical (Official Video)](http://img.youtube.com/vi/9HDEHj2yzew/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HDEHj2yzew "Dua Lipa - Physical (Official Video)")

Arguably one of Dua Lipa's best songs she's released to date, **"Physical"** had me in such a great mood when it was released. Just a month before the pandemic began, my boyfriend and I were going pretty frequently to a spin class in our neighborhood. The instructor played this song often (and for good reason): it has just the right combination of dark/edgy melody and upbeat tempo to get me pumped for a grueling workout on a bike, and the lyrics are memorable and easy to belt even when I'm sweating like crazy.

I'm sure not hearing **"Physical"** would have been difficult (because it was playing frequently on all platforms at the time and still is), but if you have yet to [listen to Future Nostalgia](https://open.spotify.com/album/7fJJK56U9fHixgO0HQkhtI?si=0jmzGr_wSzSuQkH58-CYGw "Future Nostalgia by Dua Lipa"), I highly recommend you do - If you have no opinions of Dua Lipa at this point in her career, I'm sure going through that album will give you a great one of her.

# BeyoncÃ© - _Black is King_

> ##### Released July 31st, 2020
>
> Watch here: [https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/black-is-king...](https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/black-is-king?cid=DSS-Search-Google-71700000070334051-&s_kwcid=AL!8468!3!453146789687!e!!g!!black%20is%20king&gclid=Cj0KCQiAlsv_BRDtARIsAHMGVSbcgInv9V-9lEXAO9MAfs3drvR4urIsI1SzunyfR8XsUMLd4kSCx8kaAnwqEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds "Black is King by BeyoncÃ©")

[![Dua Lipa - Physical (Official Video)](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_Gct9jnaVKY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gct9jnaVKY "BeyoncÃ© - FIND YOUR WAY BACK (Official Video)")

The lewks.
The visuals.
The music.
The story.

All of which made my mouth drop to the floor. I believe at this point in the pandemic, I was running very thin on reasons to actually get out of bed each day. I was eating pretty terribly, I had gained a few extra pounds, I was unable to find ways to entertain myself...

This changed (some of) that for me. From the moment the album started, I had my eyes locked to the TV.

Though these parallels weren't immediately present as we watched **_Black is King_**, I could tell that it made a few nods to Disney's **_The Lion King_** as it told the story of a young African Prince (Folajomi Akinmurele) and his exile from his kingdom after the death of his father. He undergoes a coming-of-age thanks to the guidance of BeyoncÃ© (and her amazing fashion, hair, music, and vocals) in order to reclaim his rightful place as king ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Is_King)).

Aside from the pretty obvious Disney connection, the film serves as an allegory for reclaiming and rejoicing in black culture, heritage, and identity - BeyoncÃ©'s music in it is a necessary response to the lengthy history of oppression faced by black people, and serves as an important contribution to music (for this year especially).

# Megan Thee Stallion - _Good News_

> ##### Released November 20th, 2020
>
> Listen here: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0KjckH1EE6HRRurMIXSc0r?si=D9YS8q4pSiqPwM9YA_3Z-Q "Good News by Megan Thee Stallion")

[![Megan Thee Stallion - Savage Remix [SNL Live Performance]](http://img.youtube.com/vi/CTpilDQXYr0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTpilDQXYr0 "Megan Thee Stallion - Savage Remix [SNL Live Performance]")

I gotta give a shoutout to Ms. Thee Stallion. We honestly love a sex positive female rapper who simultaneously sheds light on social issues and drops club anthems to dance to. _Real hot girl shit_.

**"Shots Fired"** and **"Circles"** start off the album right with quick tempos that I feel like I miss out on in contemporary rap songs. Her energy has been refreshing and much needed these days.

Everyone loves **"Body"** and **"Freaky Girls"** (I especially love hearing SZA's feature on this track). We'll all be dancing to these songs in the club one day soon (I hope ðŸ¤ž).

**"Don't Rock Me To Sleep"** gives everyone a little break from the hard hitting rap tracks and probably compares to something [The Weeknd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXYlFuWEuKI "The Weeknd - Save Your Tears (Official Music Video)") would have put out in 2020.

I personally love **"What's New"** because it absolutely slaps, and the **"Savage"** remix (feat. BeyoncÃ©) is a great workout song (if that's your thing).

Go [listen](https://open.spotify.com/album/0KjckH1EE6HRRurMIXSc0r?si=D9YS8q4pSiqPwM9YA_3Z-Q "Good News by Megan Thee Stallion") now!

# The Weeknd - "Blinding Lights"

> ##### Released May 29th, 2020
>
> Watch/listen here: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NRXx6U8ABQ "The Weeknd - Blinding Lights (Official Music Video)")

[![The Weeknd - Blinding Lights (Official Music Video)](http://img.youtube.com/vi/4NRXx6U8ABQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NRXx6U8ABQ "The Weeknd - Blinding Lights (Official Music Video)")

With a melody akin to 1980's synth pop/rock, **"Blinding Lights"** is extremely addicting and just... a _really_ good song. Not to mention the music video that goes with it is by far my favorite one of the entire year, and that says a lot considering ["Rain on Me"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAm4om0wTs "Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande - Rain On Me (Official Music Video)") was also released in 2020.

Though The Weeknd has typically been known to write R&B/soul hits like ["Starboy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Na4j8AVgA "The Weeknd - Starboy ft. Daft Punk (Official Video)") and ["Can't Feel My Face"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEI4qSrkPAs "The Weeknd - Can't Feel My Face (Official Video)"), **"Blinding Lights"** is a nice departure from his traditional route of song-writing. As an added bonus, it clearly draws at least a little inspiration from [some of Michael Jackson's 80's hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdxUFDoQe0 "Michael Jackson - Beat It (Official Video)")

# Lady Gaga - _Chromatica_

> ##### Released January 21st, 2020
>
> Listen here: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/05c49JgPmL4Uz2ZeqRx5SP?si=lDRDW9zCRhO7xFPn6l8AQA "Chromatica by Lady Gaga")

[![Lady Gaga Performs a Medley of "Chromatica II", "Rain On Me" (ft. Ariana Grande), & More](http://img.youtube.com/vi/5D4vjndnB0w/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D4vjndnB0w "Lady Gaga Performs a Medley of 'Chromatica II', 'Rain On Me' (ft. Ariana Grande), & More")

This is probably my favorite album of 2020.

If I was forced to pick one album and one album only from last year, I think this would be it. Gaga released it at just the right time; every song on it is memorable, energetic, & arranged well; and it clearly stands up even to some of Gaga's biggest, most beloved hits of her career.

To me, _*Chromatica*_ is energizing. I remember having quite a difficult time in quarantine for some months last year, and when Gaga released this album, I had a reason to go outside. I listened to it countless times on walks and runs around my neighborhood in Boston to the point that it was something I looked forward to each day. I would say that overall, there aren't many albums that make me want to workout, so adding this one to my list was a pleasure.

Great job, Gaga. I can't wait to dance to this in the club soon!

# Honorable Mentions:

Let me start off by saying that the list above is definitely pretty basic. I understand that. My goal for 2021 is to expand my musical lexicon so that next year, my favorite albums/songs are much more diverse (and dare I say... obscure?). With that said, I have a few extras to add that I didn't have enough time to review but that you should fully listen to:

1. "Laugh Now Cry Later" by Drake
2. _SAWAYAMA_ by Rina Sawayama
3. Just... The entire lofi-beats genre as a whole
4. "Never Seen The Rain" by Tones and I
5. "ringtone (Remix) feat. Charli XCX, Rico Nasty, Kero Kero Bonito" by 100 gecs
6. Actually just the whole album _100 gecs and The Tree of Clues_ (wish I would have listened to it more last year to give it a decent enough review)
7. "Let Go" by D Smoke, SiR
8. "Foyer" by Wild Nothing
9. "Aftertaste" by Loud Luxury, Morgan St. Jean
10. "WKND" by SONIKKU

You can find the playlist [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6iy7ErA3RsWhy35W3oDvx4?si=ltQuVBurRcahKMmEtS07vQ "52weeks: Week 1 - Treading Lightly"). Enjoy!
